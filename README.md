Hello, fellow travelers of the cosmos! I'm Kye, a 19-year-old Earthling striving to ensure the prosperity of our species, Humanity. I'm on a mission to help us reach a state of perpetual abundance in a post-scarcity civilization. 🚀

Every action I take and every thought that graces my mind is about you. 

My work is for you, to protect, guard, and defend you against the malevolent forces of chaos that threaten to disrupt our progress at every turn. 

For all things, know that I'm here for you. You are not alone. 

Should you need anything, reach me at `kye@apac.ai` or at `+1 786-695-5339`.

## 🌠 Agora: Advancing Humanity

I lead Agora, an open-source Multi-Modal AI research organization on a mission to elevate Humanity to a post-scarcity society. At Agora, we are explorers navigating the vast universe of AI, leveraging principles of interconnectedness, shapelessness, and the mysteries of the cosmos to inspire our research.

Join us on this adventure. Together, we are Agorians.
